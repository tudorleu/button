## Installation

The project is set up according to the Go standards, so commands such as `go install` and `go build` should work. You may need to install some dependencies, which `godep` might help with.

The port on which the server starts is taken from an environment variable, so after building, start with: `PORT=1234 button`.

## API

 * `POST /user` - Creates a new user, returns a User object. Parameters: `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
 * `GET /user/:id` - Retrieves a user with the given id.
 * `POST /user/:id/transfer` - Creates a transfer for the given user. Parameters: `amount`
 * `GET /user/:id/transfers` - Lists the transfers for the given user.
